About two years ago, I noticed that students at my school found it tedious to access their timetables, homework, and student bulletin from their smartphones.

I decided to develop a mobile app that would make HTTP requests to the school's servers in the background and quickly format and display the response data when opened, functioning on both Android and iOS devices.

I used Java to develop for Android and Objective-C to develop for iOS. The apps are now used by over 1100 students on both platforms.
